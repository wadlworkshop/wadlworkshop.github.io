# History of the WADL Workshop

The most recent related workshop, WADL 2023 was held as a hybrid, [in-person/virtual event](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2023.html), in conjunction with [ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) 2023](https://2023.jcdl.org/). This event consisted of the presentation of 5 peer-reviewed and accepted papers as well as lightning and drop-in talks by attendees both in-person at the event and remotely attending. The agenda remains available at [https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2023.html](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2023.html). [WADL 2022](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html) was held virtually due to the pandemic, but hosted 13 peer-reviewed paper talks and two invited presentations throughout the full-day session. The schedule remains available at [https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html). Likewise, schedules for previous iterations of the workshop from [2020](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2020.html), [2019](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2019.html), [2018](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2018.html), [2017](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2017.html), and [2016](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2016.html) are available at the links provided. While the workshop has previously coincided with JCDL, the authors lookg forward to expanding to the community of interested researchers that attend [ACM Hypertext](https://ht.acm.org/ht2025/).

In the 2023 iteration of the conference, we received very positive feedback from participants and are therefore strongly encouraged to continue the workshop in 2025.
Two previous WADL meetings resulted in the publication of a special issue in the IEEE TCDL Bulletin such as in 
[2016](https://bulletin.jcdl.org/Bulletin/v13n1/papers/intro.pdf) and [2015](https://bulletin.jcdl.org/Bulletin/v11n2/papers/intro.pdf) and the workshop organizers are motivated to revitalize this effort with 
WADL 2025. Other workshop proceedings will be openly accessible from [VTechWorks](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/), Virginia Tech's institutional repository.

A previous workshop, [WIRE](https://lazerlab.net/event/wire-workshop-working-internet-archives-research), focused on research of archival holdings and on making use of archives that preserve the
web. The first workshop on Web Archiving and Digital Libraries, WADL 2013, led to [a summary](https://sigir.org/files/forum/2013D/p128.pdf) after a group responded to the call for meeting as part of the JCDL 2013 workshop program. 

An earlier similar workshop at a prior JCDL conference [took place in Ottawa in 2011](http://infolab.stanford.edu/wac/), partly as a result of the emergence of a [cooperative to explore web archiving](https://cs.harding.edu/wag2011/). Broader in scope but related are the annual General Assembly meetings of the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)](https://netpreserve.org/).

In addition, various sponsored programs have connected, like [a closely related initiative](https://library.columbia.edu/collections/web-archives.html) funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
