# Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop 2025 Call for Papers

To be held in conjunction with [36th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (HT 2025)](https://ht.acm.org/ht2025/).

* September 15 - 19, 2025
* Chicago, Illinois, USA

The Web Archiving and Digital Libraries Workshop (WADL) is back! Join us in-person or online at the ACM Hypertext Conference in Chicago this September!

WADL 2025 will continue its tradition of providing a forum and collaboration platform for international leaders from academia, industry, and government to discuss challenges, and share insights, in designing and implementing concepts, tools, and standards in the realm of web archiving. Together, we will explore the integration of web archiving and digital libraries, over the complete digital resource life cycle: creation/authoring, uploading, publishing on the web, crawling/collecting, compressing, formatting, storing, preserving, analyzing, indexing, supporting access, etc.

WADL 2025 will cover all topics of interest and specifically invite contributions from practitioners. Topics include but are not limited to:

- Enhancing Hypertextual Archives: Exploring how web archives serve as historical repositories of hypertext content and how link-based data can be analyzed over time.
- Leveraging AI and NLP in Digital Libraries: Investigating how machine learning and NLP techniques can improve web archive searchability, classification, and metadata extraction.
- Decentralized Web Archiving: Discussing the role of blockchain, peer-to-peer (P2P) storage, and federated models in building resilient web archives.
- Ethical and Social Implications of Web Archiving: Addressing misinformation, censorship, diversity, and biases in digital preservation.
- Interactive and User-Centric Archival Interfaces: Exploring hyperlinked knowledge graphs, linked open data, and immersive storytelling techniques that leverage web archives.
